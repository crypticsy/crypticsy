### Hey ðŸ‘‹, Fancy seeing you here ! &nbsp; o(*ï¿£â–½ï¿£*)ãƒ–

I am a data analytics and machine learning practitioner and learner who can switch into mutliple roles (Analyst, Developer, Tester, Illustrator & Photographer) depending on the situation. Solving a problem and visualizing the insights with the help of machine learning algorithms and data visualization tools has always been a superpower for me. Hence I envision myself pursuing fields that intrigue my interest, and become more than a mere human who is fascinated by coding.
